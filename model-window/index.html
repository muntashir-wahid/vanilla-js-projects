        <p>
          The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language
          for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be
          assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and
          scripting languages such as JavaScript
        </p>
        <p>
          Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local
          storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML
          describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally
          included cues for the appearance of the document.

        <p>
          Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for
          describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language
          such as HTML.CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web,
          alongside HTML and JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
          CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content,
          including layout, colors, and fonts.This separation can improve
          content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the
          specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web
          pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate
          .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural
          content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page
          load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.

        <h2 class="heading">Read about JavaScript</h2>
        <p>
          JavaScript often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one
          of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and
          CSS.Over 97% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for web
          page behavior,often incorporating third-party libraries.All major web
          browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on
          users' devices.
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that
          conforms to the ECMAScript standard.It has dynamic typing,
          prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is
          multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative
          programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs)
          for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data
          structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
